                        <p>"I was going through a really tough time during my junior year. I felt completely isolated and thought no one cared. Then one day, a friend I hadn't talked to in months sent me a simple text: 'Hey, are you okay? I've been thinking about you.'</p>
                        <p>That one message made me realize I wasn't invisible. We started talking regularly, and having someone who listened without judgment changed everything. Now I try to reach out to others, because I know how much it meant to me."</p>

                        <h3>Breaking the Silence</h3>
                        <p>"I used to think talking about mental health was weak. I struggled with anxiety for years, keeping it all inside because I was afraid of what people would think.</p>
                        <p>Then I saw a post from Against the Current about peer stories, and something clicked. I decided to tell a close friend. Instead of judging me, they said, 'Me too. I've been dealing with something similar.'</p>
                        <p>That conversation opened up a whole new level of friendship. We check in on each other now, and I realize that talking about it actually made me stronger, not weaker."</p>

                        <p>"I was in a dark place, thinking no one would understand. A classmate noticed I'd been quiet and asked if I wanted to talk. At first I said no, but they kept checking in—not pushy, just genuinely caring.</p>
                        <p>Eventually I opened up, and they listened. They didn't try to fix everything, they just made me feel heard. That connection helped me realize I could reach out for professional help too.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes the biggest thing someone can do is just be there and listen. That's what peer support means to me."</p>

                        <p>"I felt like I was the only one struggling with stress and feeling overwhelmed. School, college applications, family stuff—it all felt like too much.</p>
                        <p>I joined a peer support group at school (something I never thought I'd do), and it was life-changing. Just being in a room with other students who got it, who understood without me having to explain everything.</p>
                        <p>We created a group chat where we check in on each other. Having that support network made all the difference. Now I know I don't have to swim against the current alone."</p>
