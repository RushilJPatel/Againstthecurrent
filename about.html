                        <p>Against the Current is dedicated to promoting mental wellness among high school students through peer support and connectedness. We believe that when students feel they belong and can openly discuss mental health, protective factors increase and risk factors decrease.</p>
                        <p>Like koi fish swimming against the current, we're working to break down barriers, reduce stigma, and create a supportive community where every student feels valued and heard.</p>
